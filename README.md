"Tight Concentrations and Confidence Sequences from the Regret of Universal Portfo"
[ArXiv 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14099.pdf)

The algorithms construct a sequence of time-uniform confidence intervals, also known as confidence sequences, using a betting approach.
In particular, the regret of universal portfolio algorithms is used to construct implicit concentration inequalities that are numerically inverted.

Take a look at demo.m for an example of usage.
