This MATLAB software package implements the algorithms in the paper

Orabona and Jun,
"Tight Concentrations and Confidence Sequences from the Regret of Universal Portfolio",
[ArXiv 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14099.pdf

Update: The paper is now published in [IEEE Trans. on Information Theory](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315047).

The algorithms construct a sequence of time-uniform confidence intervals, also known as confidence sequences, using a betting approach.
In particular, the regret of universal portfolio algorithms is used to construct implicit concentration inequalities that are numerically inverted.

Take a look at demo.m for an example of usage.
